When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
-when we would like to share our repository with other co-workers we can create a remote repository and share the link.
the remote copy can be pulled from the github and we can even push our changes to the github remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
-pulling changes manually gives you flexiblity. 
you can manually pull whenever you have finished updating or adding something to your file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-forks: we fork someones repository when we want to have a copy of those files in our git hub
and later we can clone this repository onto our local machine.
clones:we could clone files from github to our local machine or clone files from our local directory 
to a different local directory.
branches:branches are for working on different version of our code we could make a different branch and
add our new funtionality and later we could merge it with the master branch so we can combine the new feature.
