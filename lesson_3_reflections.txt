When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
-when we would like to share our repository with other co-workers we can create a remote repository and share the link.
the remote copy can be pulled from the github and we can even push our changes to the github remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
-pulling changes manually gives you flexiblity. 
you can manually pull whenever you have finished updating or adding something to your file.
